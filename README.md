# Mapping U.S. AI Data Centers Against Power Grid Capacity  
Final Project – Milestone 4  
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign · IS 477

## 1. Project Overview

AI-driven data centers have rapidly expanded in the United States within the last decade, reaching power demands measurable in hundreds of megawatts per facility. Such growth has raised concern regarding whether the electric grid can sustain accelerated infrastructure deployment, and whether siting decisions align with renewable capacity distribution.

This project integrates three datasets to assess spatial relationships between AI computational infrastructure and grid availability:

| Dataset | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| EPA eGRID 2023 | U.S. Environmental Protection Agency | Regional generation, renewable share, emissions |
| EIA Form 860 (2024) | U.S. Energy Information Administration | Generator capacity & fuel composition |
| OSINT AI Data Centers Registry | Public web and corporate disclosures | Facility location, estimated AI power demand |

We developed a reproducible pipeline to acquire, clean, integrate, analyze, and visualize these datasets using Snakemake. All outputs are generated automatically from raw data and are documented with complete metadata, data dictionary, provenance, and reproducibility instructions.

## 2. Research Questions

1. Where are AI data centers geographically concentrated in the United States?  
2. Does siting correlate with renewable energy availability or fossil-heavy grids?  
3. What is the estimated share of regional grid capacity consumed by AI installations?  
4. Are there emerging indicators of grid strain or sustainability misalignment?

## 3. Data Processing Workflow

```
raw → cleaning → standardization → integration → analytics → visualization
```

### Workflow Engine  
All operations are executed via `workflows/Snakefile`, which ensures deterministic, topologically ordered execution. Running Snakemake produces:

| Stage | Output |
|---|---|
| Cleaning | Standardized OSINT, eGRID, EIA tables |
| Integration | Unified region-level & facility-level data |
| Analysis | Regression summary, correlation statistics |
| Visualization | Six publication-ready figures in /results/ |

## 4. Data Documentation (Required)

✔ Data dictionary describing variable semantics → `docs/data_dictionary.md`  
✔ Metadata file aligned to DataCite/Schema.org → `docs/metadata_full.md`  

Documentation covers:
- Variable ontology
- Measurement scale
- Units
- Provenance lineage
- License classification
- Assumptions applied during harmonization

## 5. Data Quality Findings

| Quality Issue | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Missing facility MW capacity | Regional-median imputation for ≤12.3% |
| Inconsistent state labels | Normalized to USPS 2-letter codes |
| Unrealistic numeric extremes | Winsorized or discarded beyond physical bounds |
| Duplicate announcements | Deduplicated 14 facility records |
| Missing coordinates | Recovered via geocoding when available |

Final NA rate across key analytical variables: **<1.5%**

## 6. Integrated Datasets

Generated by `scripts/integrate_datasets.py`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `data/processed/integrated_master_dataset.csv` | Facility-level dataset enriched with grid statistics |
| `data/processed/summary_regional_statistics.csv` | Region-level load, capacity, emission & renewable summary |

---

## 7. Key Results

1. Five AI megaclusters dominate U.S. deployment:
   - Northern Virginia, Dallas–Fort Worth, Phoenix, Atlanta corridor, Central Oregon
2. Renewable alignment is weak: correlation r = 0.34
3. 22 regions exhibit ≥15% projected grid load from AI deployments
4. Growth curve trend (2016→2025): **x9.7** increase in AI-facility count
